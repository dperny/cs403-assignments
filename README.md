#CS 403 Assignments

This is a collection of programming assignments I completed for CS 403 at 
The University of Alabama with Dr. John Lusth. All assignments, despite the 
file extensions, are done in 
[the Scam programming language](beastie.cs.ua.edu/scam), which is almost but 
not quite like Scheme.
